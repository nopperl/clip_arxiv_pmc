Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models are able to capture the semantic relationship of images and texts and have enabled a wide range of  applications, from image retrieval to classification. These models are trained with datasets extracted from web crawls, which are of large quantity but limited quality. This paper explores whether limited amounts of higher quality data with limited domain coverage improve the performance of CLIP models. To this purpose, we extract text-image data from scientific papers hosted in the arXiv and PubMedCentral repositories.
Experiments on small-scale CLIP models (ViT B/32) results show that model performance increases on average, but only moderately. This result indicates that using the data sources considered in the paper to train large-scale CLIP models is a worthwile research direction.
